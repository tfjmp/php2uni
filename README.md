# php2uni

To get started simply:

$ make install
$ make all

The install phase may take a while (around 30mins) and will require root privileges.
However it needs to be executed only once.

To modify the site create/edit PHP files in seed and modify in consequence the routes file.
At the moment very small subset of PHP is supported and type annotation is required.
Better support and a proper parser will come next!
